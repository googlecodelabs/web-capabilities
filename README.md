# Web Capabilities Codelab Resources

We want to close the capability gap between the web and native and make it easy for developers to build great experiences on the open web. We strongly believe that every developer should have access to the capabilities they need to make a great web experience, and we are committed to a more capable web.

There are, however, some capabilities, like file system access, idle detection, and more that are available to native but that aren’t available on the web. These missing capabilities mean some types of apps can't be delivered on the web, or are less useful.

We will design and develop these new capabilities in an open and transparent way, using the existing open web platform standards processes while getting early feedback from developers and other browser vendors as we iterate on the design, to ensure an interoperable design.

## What you will build
In this codelab, you'll play around with a number of brand-new—or sometimes even only “available-behind-a-flag”—web APIs. So rather than on a finished product, this codelab’s focus is more on the actual APIs themselves and on use cases that these APIs unlock.

## What you’ll learn
This codelab will teach you the basic mechanics of several bleeding edge APIs. Note that these mechanics aren’t set in stone quite yet, and we very much appreciate your feedback on the developer flow.

## What you’ll need
As the APIs featured in this codelab are really bleeding edge, requirements for each API will vary. Please make sure to carefully read the compatibility information at the beginning of each section.
How to approach the codelab
The codelab is not necessarily meant to be worked through sequentially. Each section represents an independent API, so feel free to cherry pick what interests you the most.
